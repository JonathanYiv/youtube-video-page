# YouTube Video Page Project

This purpose of this project was to practice embedding images/video in HTML/CSS by implementing the [Youtube Video Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/embedding-images-and-video).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

No particular thoughts going in.
I just hope all this HTML/CSS doesn't make me rusty in Rails.

## Post-Project Thoughts

I didn't spent much time on the CSS, obviously, because this section is about HTML structure and embedding media.
I did ensure to properly embed both videos/images and follow proper HTML structure by thinking about what meaning I was imbuing content with as I surrounded them with tags.
Both HTML and CSS were validated using W3C's validators.
It was an easy project.
Probably took around 20 minutes.
