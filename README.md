# YouTube Video Page Project

This purpose of this project was to practice embedding images/video in HTML/CSS by implementing the [Youtube Video Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/embedding-images-and-video).
